Criticize the following recursive function:
public static String exR2(int n)
{
    String s = exR2(n-3) + n + exR2(n-2) + n;
    if (n <= 0) return "";
    return s;
}

Answer : The base case will never be reached. A call to exR2(3) will result in calls to
exR2(0), exR2(-3), exR3(-6), and so forth until a StackOverflowError occurs.
